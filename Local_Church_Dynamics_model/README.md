# Local Church Dynamics

This is my semestral project for the Modeling and Simulation course at FI MUNI.
Goal of the project was to create a model of a local church, specifically the way it works with youth.

Currently it is in the state as it was by submission but it would definitely deserve some expansion.

There are the model files themselves, module for analysis using seaborn, then some generated graphs, output data sample and a report on the project in Czech.
